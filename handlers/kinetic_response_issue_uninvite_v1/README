This handler uninvites a user from a Kinetic Response Issue.

=== Parameters
[Issue Guid]
  The Issue's guid.
    * The Issue Guid can be found at the end of the url of an issue.
        - ex: {{response_server}}/issues/{{issue_guid}}
[Email]

=== Results
This handler does not return any results.

==== Sample Configuration
Issue Guid:         abc123-the-issue-guid
Email:      bob@example.com

=== Detailed Description
This handler uses basic auth to send a request to Kinetic Response to uninvite a
user from the list of users participating or invited to a Response issue. If the
inputted email matches a user included in the invites list, the guid for that
invite will be retrieved and then used to retract the invite. Similarly, if an
email match is found in the participants list, the guid for the user will be
retrieved and used to remove the user from that issue.
